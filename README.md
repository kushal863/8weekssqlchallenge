## 1. Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

### What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
### What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
### Which item was the most popular for each customer?
### Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
### Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
### What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
### If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
